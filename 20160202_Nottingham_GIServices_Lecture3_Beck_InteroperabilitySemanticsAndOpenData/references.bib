	abstract = {Ontology is a significant research theme in GIScience. While some researchers believe that the progress in GIScience is being directed through an engagement with the concept of ontology, some dismiss it as irrelevant. This paper is aimed at (i) exploring the theoretical and practical roles of ontologies; (ii) making the definitions and terminology explicit; (iii) assessing the applicability of ontology to problems in the geographical domain; and (iv) assessing whether a unified approach to ontology exists in GIScience. The results will be helpful for GIScientists in (i) understanding the validity of employing ontology within their own work, (ii) assessing what operational framework of terms and methods to use for developing their own ontology, and (iii) to assess what existing ontological models are available and applicable within their domain or application. A comprehensive and critical review will also help in identifying the signficant issues and directing future research agenda in GIScience.},

  Abstract                 = {Ontologies have been proposed and studied in the last couple of decades as a way to capture and share people's knowledge about the world in a way that is processable by computer systems. Ontologies have the potential to serve as a bridge between the human conceptual understanding of the world and the data produced, processed and stored in computer systems. However, ontologies so far have failed to gather widespread adoption, failing to realise the original vision of the semantic web as a next generation of the world wide web: where everyone would be able to contribute and interlink their data and knowledge as easily as they can contribute and interlink their websites. One of the main reasons for this lack of widespread adoption of ontologies is the steep learning curve for authoring them: most people find it too dfficult to learn the syntax and formal semantics of ontology languages. Most research has tried to alleviate this problem by finding ways to help people to collaborate with knowledge engineers when building ontologies; this approach however, requires the wide availability of knowledge engineers, who in practice are scarce. In the context of the semantic web, recent research has started looking at ways to directly capture knowledge from domain experts as ontologies. One such approach advocates the use of Controlled Natural Languages ({CNL}) as a promising way to alleviate the syntactical impediment to writing ontological constructs. However, not much is yet known about the capabilities and limitations of {CNL}-based ontology authoring by domain experts. It is also unknown what type of automatic tool support can and should be provided to novice ontology authors, although such intelligent tool support is becoming possible due to advances in reasoning with existing ontologies and other related areas such as natural language processing. This {PhD} investigates how {CNL}-based ontology authoring systems can make ontology authoring more accessible to domain experts by providing intelligent tool support. In particular, this thesis iteratively investigates the impact of providing various types of intelligent tool support for authoring ontologies using the Web Ontology Language ({OWL}) and a controlled natural language called Rabbit. After each iteration of added tool support, we evaluate how it impacts the ontology authoring process and what are the main limitations of the resulting ontology authoring system. Based on the found limitations, we decide which further tool support would be most beneficial to novice ontology authors. This methodology resulted in iteratively providing support for (i) understanding the syntactic capabilities and limitations of the chosen controlled natural language; (ii) following appropriate ontology engineering methodologies; (iii) fostering awareness about the logical consequences of adding new knowledge to an ontology and (iv) interacting with the ontology authoring system via dialogues. The main contributions of this {PhD} are (i) showing that domain experts benefit from guidance about the ontology authoring process and understandable syntax error messages for finding the correct {CNL} syntax; (ii) the definition of a framework to integrate the syntactical and semantic analyses of ontology authors' inputs; (iii) showing that intuitive feedback about the integration of ontology authors' inputs into an existing ontology benefits ontology authors as they become aware of potential ontology defects; (iv) the definition of a framework to analyse and describe ontology authoring in terms of dialogue moves and their discourse structure.},

  Abstract                 = {Geographic Information has an important role to play in linking and combining datasets through shared location, but the potential is still far from fully realized because the data is not well organized and the technology to aid this process has not been available. Developments in the Semantic Web and Linked Data, however, are making it possible to integrate data based on Geographic Information in a way that is more accessible to users. Drawing on the industry experience of a geographer and a computer scientist, Linked Data: A Geographic Perspective is a practical guide to implementing Geographic Information as Linked Data. Combine Geographic Information from Multiple Sources Using Linked Data After an introduction to the building blocks of Geographic Information, the Semantic Web, and Linked Data, the book explores how Geographic Information can become part of the Semantic Web as Linked Data. In easy-to-understand terms, the authors explain the complexities of modeling Geographic Information using Semantic Web technologies and publishing it as Linked Data. They review the software tools currently available for publishing and modeling Linked Data and provide a framework to help you evaluate new tools in a rapidly developing market. They also give an overview of the important languages and syntaxes you will need to master. Throughout, extensive examples demonstrate why and how you can use ontologies and Linked Data to manipulate and integrate real-world Geographic Information data from multiple sources. A Practical, Readable Guide for Geographers, Software Engineers, and Laypersons A coherent, readable introduction to a complex subject, this book supplies the durable knowledge and insight you need to think about Geographic Information through the lens of the Semantic Web. It provides a window to Linked Data for geographers, as well as a geographic perspective for software engineers who need to understand how to work with Geographic Information. Highlighting best practices, this book helps you organize and publish Geographic Information on the Semantic Web with more confidence.},

  Abstract                 = {The mathematical nature of description logics has meant that domain experts find them hard to understand. This forms a significant impediment to the creation and adoption of ontologies. This paper describes Rabbit, a Controlled Natural Language that can be translated into {OWL} with the aim of achieving both comprehension by domain experts and computational preciseness. We see Rabbit as complementary to {OWL}, extending its reach to those who need to author and understand domain ontologies but for whom descriptions logics are difficult to comprehend even when expressed in more user-friendly forms such as the Manchester Syntax. The paper outlines the main grammatical aspects of Rabbit, which can be broadly classified into declarations, concept descriptions and definitions, and elements to support interoperability between ontologies. The paper also describes the human subject testing that has been performed to date and indicates the changes currently being made to the language following this testing. Further modifications have been based on practical experience of the application of Rabbit for the development of operational ontologies in the domain of topography.},

	shorttitle = {Beyond Transparency},
	abstract = {The rise of open data in the public sector has sparked innovation, driven efficiency, and fueled economic development. While still emerging, we are seeing evidence of the transformative potential of open data in shaping the future of our civic life, and the opportunity to use open data to reimagine the relationship between residents and government, especially at the local level. As we look ahead, what have we learned so far from open data in practice and how we can apply those lessons to realize a more promising future for America’s cities and communities?  Edited by Brett Goldstein, former Chief Data Officer for the City of Chicago, with Code for America, this book features essays from over twenty of the world’s leading experts in a first-of-its-kind instructive anthology about how open data is changing the face of our public institutions.   Contributors include:   Michael Flowers, Chief Analytics Officer, New York City Beth Blauer, former director of Maryland {StateStat} Jonathan Feldman, {CIO}, City of Asheville Tim O’Reilly, founder \& {CEO}, O’Reilly Media Eric Gordon, Director of Engagement Game Lab, Emerson College Beth Niblock, {CIO}, Louisville Metro Government Ryan \& Mike Alfred, Co-Founders, Brightscope Emer Coleman, former director of the London Datastore Mark Headd, Chief Data Officer, City of Philadelphia    “As an essential volume for anyone interested in the future of governance, urban policy, design, data-driven policymaking, journalism, or civic engagement, "Beyond Transparency" combines the inspirational glow and political grit of Profiles in Courage with the clarity of an engineer's calm explanation of how something technical actually works. Here are the detailed how-to stories of many members of the first generation of open government pioneers, written in a generous, accessible style; this compilation presents us with a great deal to admire, ample provocation, and wise guidance from a group of remarkable individuals.”  —Susan Crawford, author of Captive Audience   “Just as he did during his time in my administration, Goldstein has brought together industry leaders to discuss issues of relevance in the open data movement and the practical implications of implementing these policies… This book will help continue the work to make open government a reality across the country.”  — Mayor Rahm Emanuel, City of Chicago   “A must-read for anyone who is passionate about what open data can do to transform city living.”  — Boris Johnson, Mayor of London},

	abstract = {We all experience it: a rising tide of information, sweeping across our professions, our families, our
globe. As a society, we now produce more information in one year than all the words spoken by all 
human generations before us. We create it, transmit it, store it, receive it, consume it – and then, 
often, reprocess it to start the cycle all over again. It gives us power unprecedented in human history 
to understand and control our world. But, equally, it challenges our institutions, upsets our work 
habits and imposes unpredictable stresses upon our lives and societies. 
In a globalised knowledge economy Europe has to strengthen its research capacity through open 
data e-Infrastructures to gain from the rising tide of scientific data1
.
Open data e-Infrastructures increase scope, depth and economies of scale of the scientific 
enterprise. They are catalysts of new and unexpected solutions to emerge by global and 
multidisciplinary research. They bridge the gap between scientists and the citizen and are enablers 
of trust in the scientific process.},
