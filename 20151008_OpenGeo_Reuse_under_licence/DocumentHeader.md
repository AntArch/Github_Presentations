  Geospatial web services provide general and niche products some of which are based on multiple data sources each data source used under licence. End-users may further chain these services to produce a myriad of other derived data products and services. The background licencing issues can become very complex. Incompatibilities between different licences means that some data products should not be integrated. Hence, licence heterogeneity is a barrier to data integration and interoperability in the way that semantic, syntactic and schematic heterogeneities are also barriers. This presentation will provide an overview of these issues, to describe a potential semantic licence framework, and through discussion better understand where the OGC might be able to help with licence, or legal, interoperability.
