  Abstract                 = {Ontologies have been proposed and studied in the last couple of decades as a way to capture and share people's knowledge about the world in a way that is processable by computer systems. Ontologies have the potential to serve as a bridge between the human conceptual understanding of the world and the data produced, processed and stored in computer systems. However, ontologies so far have failed to gather widespread adoption, failing to realise the original vision of the semantic web as a next generation of the world wide web: where everyone would be able to contribute and interlink their data and knowledge as easily as they can contribute and interlink their websites. One of the main reasons for this lack of widespread adoption of ontologies is the steep learning curve for authoring them: most people find it too dfficult to learn the syntax and formal semantics of ontology languages. Most research has tried to alleviate this problem by finding ways to help people to collaborate with knowledge engineers when building ontologies; this approach however, requires the wide availability of knowledge engineers, who in practice are scarce. In the context of the semantic web, recent research has started looking at ways to directly capture knowledge from domain experts as ontologies. One such approach advocates the use of Controlled Natural Languages ({CNL}) as a promising way to alleviate the syntactical impediment to writing ontological constructs. However, not much is yet known about the capabilities and limitations of {CNL}-based ontology authoring by domain experts. It is also unknown what type of automatic tool support can and should be provided to novice ontology authors, although such intelligent tool support is becoming possible due to advances in reasoning with existing ontologies and other related areas such as natural language processing. This {PhD} investigates how {CNL}-based ontology authoring systems can make ontology authoring more accessible to domain experts by providing intelligent tool support. In particular, this thesis iteratively investigates the impact of providing various types of intelligent tool support for authoring ontologies using the Web Ontology Language ({OWL}) and a controlled natural language called Rabbit. After each iteration of added tool support, we evaluate how it impacts the ontology authoring process and what are the main limitations of the resulting ontology authoring system. Based on the found limitations, we decide which further tool support would be most beneficial to novice ontology authors. This methodology resulted in iteratively providing support for (i) understanding the syntactic capabilities and limitations of the chosen controlled natural language; (ii) following appropriate ontology engineering methodologies; (iii) fostering awareness about the logical consequences of adding new knowledge to an ontology and (iv) interacting with the ontology authoring system via dialogues. The main contributions of this {PhD} are (i) showing that domain experts benefit from guidance about the ontology authoring process and understandable syntax error messages for finding the correct {CNL} syntax; (ii) the definition of a framework to integrate the syntactical and semantic analyses of ontology authors' inputs; (iii) showing that intuitive feedback about the integration of ontology authors' inputs into an existing ontology benefits ontology authors as they become aware of potential ontology defects; (iv) the definition of a framework to analyse and describe ontology authoring in terms of dialogue moves and their discourse structure.},

  Abstract                 = {Geographic Information has an important role to play in linking and combining datasets through shared location, but the potential is still far from fully realized because the data is not well organized and the technology to aid this process has not been available. Developments in the Semantic Web and Linked Data, however, are making it possible to integrate data based on Geographic Information in a way that is more accessible to users. Drawing on the industry experience of a geographer and a computer scientist, Linked Data: A Geographic Perspective is a practical guide to implementing Geographic Information as Linked Data. Combine Geographic Information from Multiple Sources Using Linked Data After an introduction to the building blocks of Geographic Information, the Semantic Web, and Linked Data, the book explores how Geographic Information can become part of the Semantic Web as Linked Data. In easy-to-understand terms, the authors explain the complexities of modeling Geographic Information using Semantic Web technologies and publishing it as Linked Data. They review the software tools currently available for publishing and modeling Linked Data and provide a framework to help you evaluate new tools in a rapidly developing market. They also give an overview of the important languages and syntaxes you will need to master. Throughout, extensive examples demonstrate why and how you can use ontologies and Linked Data to manipulate and integrate real-world Geographic Information data from multiple sources. A Practical, Readable Guide for Geographers, Software Engineers, and Laypersons A coherent, readable introduction to a complex subject, this book supplies the durable knowledge and insight you need to think about Geographic Information through the lens of the Semantic Web. It provides a window to Linked Data for geographers, as well as a geographic perspective for software engineers who need to understand how to work with Geographic Information. Highlighting best practices, this book helps you organize and publish Geographic Information on the Semantic Web with more confidence.},

  Abstract                 = {The mathematical nature of description logics has meant that domain experts find them hard to understand. This forms a significant impediment to the creation and adoption of ontologies. This paper describes Rabbit, a Controlled Natural Language that can be translated into {OWL} with the aim of achieving both comprehension by domain experts and computational preciseness. We see Rabbit as complementary to {OWL}, extending its reach to those who need to author and understand domain ontologies but for whom descriptions logics are difficult to comprehend even when expressed in more user-friendly forms such as the Manchester Syntax. The paper outlines the main grammatical aspects of Rabbit, which can be broadly classified into declarations, concept descriptions and definitions, and elements to support interoperability between ontologies. The paper also describes the human subject testing that has been performed to date and indicates the changes currently being made to the language following this testing. Further modifications have been based on practical experience of the application of Rabbit for the development of operational ontologies in the domain of topography.},
